elliptical-box-maker
====================

Inkscape plug-in that generates drawings for an elliptical box which can be made using a laser cutter.

This is a work in progress and not very useful at the moment.

Installation
------------
You need to copy ell_box.py and ell_box.inx to your Inkscape extensions directory.

On Windows:
* Local install: put both files in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions
* System wide install: put the files in C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions

On Linux:
* Local install: put both files in ~/.config/inkscape/extensions
* System wide: put them in /usr/share/inkscape/extensions
